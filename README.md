**1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving**

This project allow the user to get information from a file and check varies ways of the amount of time the item has appeared, and finally import the data into a new file.

**2. What did you do particularly well?**

Definitely using the map as I think it is a crucial piece to creating the codes for the project, due to it being easy to keep track of multiple values of the same type and count them in there efficiently as opposed to an array.
  
**3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**

I unfortunately made the mistake of the putting my personal drive location of the item file to test it out the codes (which I fixed now) and forgetting to change it back to the intended file name. While it doesn't seem much, it definitely was an eye-opener in case I work for an company, as it can cause errors in testing for others if I don't use the correct file name to read from. Another issue I seen was that I created the data file when exiting the program but the requirements state to create in the beginning of the program. I think I need to focus on throughly reading the requirements and not get ahead of myself as future along the road, it can cause me to lose my job potientally.

**4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**

Maps is something I recently learn and while it was fun to use, it was diffcult to understand at first. Thanks to SNHU Academic Support, they were able to walk me throught maps and create an efficient code that contributes to the project needs. I will continue to improve my skills in maps, and others using w3schools, as they are also fantastic at giving examples on topics we need understanding on.

**5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**

In the last few semester in SNHU, I noticed that classes are very important. It plays a part in Java and C++, and I seen it play some part in Python as well. Classes make coding a lot easier thanks to the encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Maps are a new thing to me but I can see it being in other projects or coursework as it combine efficiency with versatility, allowing multiple solutions to problems.

**6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

The use of class, in which its private and public access modifiers have attributes to help display item frequency properly. 
I create the methods for each menu options inside the class and called in the main.cpp indiviually while using a "do-while" so that it reduces the amount of codes to get the input from the user each time and reuse the input data given as it is shared within the class.
